Some derivers may need a custom identifier in order to specify custom behavior in o1js. This can be done by modifying the deriver function of the field.

An example is the `StateHash` deriver:

```ocaml

let deriver obj =
  Fields_derivers_zkapps.(
    iso_string ~name:"StateHash" ~js_type:Field ~to_string:to_base58_check
      ~of_string:of_base58_check_exn
    |> needs_custom_js ~name:"StateHash" ~js_type:field)
    obj

```

To consume a custom deriver and add custom behavior, `transaction-leaves-bigint.ts` and `transaction-leaves.ts` must be changed.

To regenerate them, check out the [mina repository](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina) and run `make snarkyjs` (heads up: there are a lot of things to install and set up if you build mina the first time).
